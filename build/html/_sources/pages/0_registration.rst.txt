User redirect

When a user decides to register for the ebox, the HIP must redirect him to https://secure.doccle.be/kbc-ebox/register and add the following query string parameters:

returnUrl: After registration, the user will be sent back to your platform via this url
The returnUrl must be url-safe encoded
reference: An identifier of the user in your system. This is can be used to link machine to machine messages to the correct user in your system.
The reference must be url-safe encoded
Example: https://secure.doccle.be/kbc-ebox/register?returnUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yourdomain.be%2FEboxRegistrationCompleted&reference=XYZ

FAS log on and Consent Page

The user will start registration process at the FAS. He will log in using any of the provided authentication methods: itsme, eID, ...

After authentication, the user agrees with the terms and conditions on the consent page. Note that the language of the FAS login page and consent page cannot be controlled by the eBox connector (not supported by FAS).

After registration

The user will be redirected back to the returnUrl you provided. The eBox connector will add a query string parameter with the result of the registration process:

status: Reflects the outcome of the eBox registration process. Is always present.
values:
"ok"
"cancelled"
